# üìä Chase Customer Complaints Analysis (2022‚Äì2024)

## 1. Background & Overview
Chase, one of the largest U.S. banks, receives tens of thousands of consumer complaints each year through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). This analysis examines **46k+ consumer complaints between 2022‚Äì2024**, covering the bank‚Äôs core product offerings including deposit accounts, credit cards, mortgages, and consumer lending.  

The project synthesizes complaint volume trends, resolution patterns, geographic distribution, and product-specific pain points to identify opportunities for operational improvements and improved customer experience.

## 4. Strategic Insights Deep Dive

### Rising Complaint Volume Highlights Systemic Challenges
Chase complaints grew **52% from 2022 to 2024**, with concerning acceleration in growth rates rather than stabilization. The 28% increase in 2023 followed by sustained 24% growth in 2024 indicates underlying operational or policy changes driving persistent customer dissatisfaction. This pattern highlights the need for a comprehensive customer experience audit across core service delivery channels.  

---

### Core Banking Products Drive Majority of Complaints
Bank accounts and credit cards collectively account for **30,322 complaints (65%)**, with checking accounts and general-purpose credit cards representing the highest-friction customer touchpoints. This concentration suggests that core retail banking products ‚Äî the services used most frequently ‚Äî are where customers encounter the most friction. Improvement in these areas would have the biggest impact on customer satisfaction.  

---

### Account Management Drives the Largest Share of Complaints
Account management complaints totaled **17,786 incidents (38%)**, representing the single largest customer pain point. These included account access, statement issues, and service representative interactions.  

Combined with billing disputes (**10,742 complaints**) and credit reporting problems (**9,257 complaints**), these three categories drove **37,785 complaints (81%)**. This concentration indicates specific operational processes requiring systematic redesign rather than product-level issues.  

---

### Declining Relief Rates May Impact Customer Trust and Retention
Customer relief rates declined consistently from **20% in 2022 to 17% in 2024**, while explanation-only resolutions increased to **83%**.  

This shift suggests either tightened internal resolution policies or improved complaint validity screening. However, from a customer experience perspective, declining relief rates during a period of increasing complaint volume may contribute to negative brand perception and customer attrition, particularly among high-value segments.  

---

### Five States Account for Over Half of Complaints
Five states‚Äî**California (7,792 complaints), Texas (4,237), Florida (4,725), New York (5,290), and Illinois (2,699)**‚Äîaccount for **52%** of all complaints.  

While population density partially explains this concentration, the disproportionate volumes indicate **regional operational variations or market-specific service delivery gaps that present opportunities for targeted improvement**.  

---

## 5. Recommendations
- **Strengthen product support** for bank accounts and credit cards, which generate 65% of complaints and represent core customer touchpoints.  
- **Investigate account management and billing processes** to address the top complaint drivers totaling 37,785 incidents (81%).  
- **Reevaluate resolution policies** as declining relief rates (22% ‚Üí 17%) and heavy reliance on ‚Äúexplanation only‚Äù responses may damage customer trust.  
- **Target regional improvements** in California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Illinois, which account for 52% of complaints.  
- **Implement proactive monitoring** to identify and resolve issues before they escalate to formal complaints, particularly for high-frequency problems like account management and billing disputes.

## 6. Methodology Notes

**Tools & Techniques**  
This project was done entirely in **Microsoft Excel**, leveraging:  
- **Power Query** for cleaning, filtering, and standardizing product/issue categories and preparing the dataset  
- **Pivot Tables** for aggregation  
- **Pivot Charts** (bar, column, line, and map charts) for visualizing key trends and distributions  
- **Calculated Fields** for year-over-year growth percentages  
- **KPI Cards** to highlight total complaints, growth rates, and resolution metrics  
- **Map Chart** for geographic hotspot analysis  

**Data Limitations**  
- Analysis limited to complaints filed through CFPB; does not capture internal complaint resolution or alternative channels.  
- Some complaint categories standardized may not perfectly align with internal Chase product classifications.
